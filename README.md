# Pathfinding Visualizer for Smart City Traffic Management

This is a JavaFX-based application to visualize pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra's, and BFS) for smart city traffic management. It provides a graphical interface to display the performance of different algorithms in real-time.

## Features
- Interactive grid-based visualization
- Support for multiple pathfinding algorithms
- Real-time updates with dynamic traffic simulation

## Technologies Used
- Java, JavaFX, Maven

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the project with Maven: `mvn clean package`.
3. Run the application: `java -jar target/pathfinding-visualizer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
